Decision-Tree
=============

Decision trees are fundamental objects in mathematics and in computer science, with applications in image classification (e.g., object detection such as faces, pedestrians, or rats in a lab via sensors which project infrared red grid on these objects), addressing health concerns via a series of questions about symptoms to identify cancer or other malicious viruses, determining the chance of winning a poker game, etc. This is my first code that I put together. It is rather simple but it represents a variety of ideas in Python.
